# Customer-Segmentation-using-RFM-Analysis
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis technique. By analyzing customer transaction data, I segmented customers into categories such as "New Customers", "Loyal Customers", "At Risk Customers", and "Lost Customers", providing valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies.
